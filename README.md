See the [pull requests](https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/pulls) for the current list of proposals.

Philosophical discussions should happen over in the [forums](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-CDI-2015/). We also have [gitter](https://gitter.im/arenanet/api-cdi) set up for semi-synchronous communication, if you prefer that.
